const e={},t="When I worked at Campus Labs, our design team was constantly trying to improve the accessibility of our platform and I learned a lot of basics from working with them on fixes. When I moved on to smaller startups, I became the voice for improving accessibility as the relative expert and learned even more in trying to teach these practices to others. I think it is most important to add some static checking like `eslint/jsx-a11y` to catch some basic issues. And using something like _React Testing Library_ as it is documented gets you very far in making accessible components. I've also learned the basics of using VoiceOver on Mac to test accessibility more completely.\n";export{e as attributes,t as markdown};
