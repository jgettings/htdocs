As the relative Java expert in my time at _Studio_, I did a small amount of maintenance on the Central Park Android App in 2015. Learning the basics of mobile development was very interesting but I haven't had a chance to apply those skills elsewhere professionally. In my own time I have tinkered a little bit with React Native but nothing worth showcasing.

Since most of my work has been in webapps I have created many responsive components, apps, and pages. Usually this has involved a component library or css framework but I've also created plenty of responsive UIs from scratch with media queries.
