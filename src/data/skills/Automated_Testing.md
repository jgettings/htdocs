I tend to wind up being the person on the team who is always pushing for more meaningful tests. I don't just want code coverage metrics though, I want tests that will ensure that specific issues do not reoccur and tests that make development easier. A lot of times this means adding end-to-end tests or figuring out how to write a test around a clunky piece of legacy code that no one wants to touch. I've also found a lot of value in writing scripts to create test data in the dev database on a few different occasions, which has helped me in developing a feature but also helps the team maintain that feature and others as the test data is expanded to more use cases.
