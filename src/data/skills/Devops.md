The majority of my deployed devops experience has been in my time at _Campus Labs_ working with Azure. I was very hands on with spinning up new webapps (APIs and/or frontends), scaling existing apps, and monitoring everything. There I also owned a lot of the build and deploy pipelines in Azure DevOps for our team.

I'm also always a big proponent of investing a little bit of extra time making dev processes and scripts easier and more straightforward. This usually comes in the form of iterative improvements to local testing and how we run apps locally. I also really like tools like Storybook to help run and test components in isolation while also documenting them for future devs.
