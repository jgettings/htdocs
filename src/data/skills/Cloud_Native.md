In my time at _Campus Labs_, we were constantly trying to move things to more scalable infrastructure. We leveraged some cloud services in Microsoft Azure for things like scheduled mailings that needed to go to many people, processing data asynchronously, etc. Pretty much anything that could be done asynchronously outside of the main webapp got moved to Azure Functions (similar to AWS Lambda) and some of these used Azure Tables or Blob Storage for persistence. Many of these services also used Azure Storage Queues or Azure Service Bus.
