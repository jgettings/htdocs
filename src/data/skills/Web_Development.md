I learned HTML and JavaScript in high school and tinkered with websites throughout college. Professionally, I've almost always worked on webapps - either MVC backend with a lightweight frontend or a RESTful/GraphQL backend with a full frontend framework. I've been through all of the browser compatibility issues of the early 2000's and working with plain javascript without a framework enough to understand the fundamentals very well.
