I started using React in 2016 when the team I was on at Campus Labs decided to switch. I began the migration alone, with some guidance from other teams that had already made the switch, and later taught others how to use React. From there I went on to fully frontend roles at Crisp and Wagmo, both using React nearly 100% of the time.

I've worked with class components and _Redux_ for state management but I've also worked a lot with functional components, hooks, and context for global state. For most of the apps I've worked on it's made more sense to persist everything on the backend and use _React Query_ or _Apollo GraphQL_ to access that data.
